# 455-reactor-design-project
This reactor design project models the BZ reaction under specific initial concentrations of reactants (Malonic acid and oxidizable organic species).

"BZ reaction was first discovered by a Russian scientist Belousov. In this reaction the system undergoes a reaction with an oscillatory change of color. For a long time his findings were dismissed, since people were uncomfortable with an idea that system may go back and forth from the thermodynamical equilibrium. It was much later when Zhabotinsky confirmed the findings of Belousov, the reaction became so famous reaction, that UBC CHBE department decided to use that to show off CHBE research to the high school students."
